The parcel delivery industry has seen a significant increase in online shopping, and with it, an increase in the number of packages being delivered. While home delivery is convenient for many, it can be challenging for customers who are not available to receive the package during the day. Many delivery services provide a pickup option, but they are often located in inconvenient locations or have limited operating hours. Additionally, package theft and delivery errors can cause frustration for customers.

Our self-service parcel pickup service will provide a convenient and secure alternative to traditional home delivery and pickup services. By offering multiple pickup locations that are easily accessible and available 24/7, your service can provide customers with the flexibility to collect their packages at their convenience. Furthermore, our service will ensure package security and provide real-time updates on its whereabouts offering customers peace of mind that their packages are safe.

Our project addresses the pain points of the current delivery and pickup services. By providing a convenient and secure self-service parcel pickup service, it will solve the issue of missed deliveries, inconvenient pickup locations, and package theft. Additionally, by offering a seamless and user-friendly experience, our project can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
